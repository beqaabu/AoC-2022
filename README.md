## Advent of Code 2022
AoC 2022 solutions by me, written in rust. Main purpose of this pproject is to help me have some fun, practice a bit of competitive programming and explore some new horizons in rust. The structure of the project was inspired by [this](https://github.com/agubelu/AoC-rust-template).   

You can run the project with `cargo run --release <nth_day>`
